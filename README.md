# Learning to Reset

This repository explores dynamic context management for mathematical reasoning with a `<clean>` token, a one-shot reset manager, and reward shaping for reset-aware training.

## Current Scope

The repository currently covers three core software primitives:

- SFT trace curation that teaches the model when to emit `<clean>`
- A one-shot context manager that handles `y0 -> optional <clean> -> y1`
- Modified RLOO utilities that propagate the final reward through both segments
- Dataset loaders and prompt builders for trace and Countdown-style records
- Deterministic split and batching helpers for future training/evaluation loops
- JSONL artifact export and CLI preparation command for trainer-ready splits
- Countdown answer verification for evaluating generated expressions
- SFT runtime for prepared supervised traces
- Clean-aware reward and trajectory assembly for Countdown rollouts
- Reset-aware RLOO runtime with local metrics and checkpointing
- Clean-aware evaluation that retries once after `<clean>` by default

The repository now supports the baseline pipeline over prepared artifacts: prepare data, run SFT, run reset-aware RLOO, and evaluate with the one-shot clean retry path. The main remaining work is wiring the real datasets and model checkpoints into that pipeline and producing the paper-aligned experiment runs.

## Quick Start

Run the tests:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Run the baseline mechanics demo:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m learning_to_reset
```

Install the local training stack:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
./.venv/bin/pip install transformers datasets accelerate torch
```

Prepare split JSONL artifacts from raw trace and Countdown files:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m learning_to_reset.prepare_artifacts \
  --traces path/to/traces.jsonl \
  --countdown path/to/countdown.jsonl \
  --output-dir output/prepared
```

Run SFT on prepared artifacts:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src ./.venv/bin/python -m learning_to_reset.sft_runtime \
  --train output/prepared/sft-train.jsonl \
  --validation output/prepared/sft-validation.jsonl \
  --model path/or/model-name \
  --output-dir output/checkpoints/sft
```

Run Countdown generation and scoring:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src ./.venv/bin/python -m learning_to_reset.eval_runtime \
  --prepared-countdown output/prepared/countdown-test.jsonl \
  --model path/or/model-name \
  --output-dir output/eval/countdown
```

Run reset-aware RLOO on prepared Countdown prompts:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src ./.venv/bin/python -m learning_to_reset.rloo_runtime \
  --train output/prepared/countdown-train.jsonl \
  --validation output/prepared/countdown-validation.jsonl \
  --model output/checkpoints/sft \
  --output-dir output/checkpoints/rloo \
  --responses-per-prompt 4
```

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Point the preparation command at the actual expert-trace and Countdown source files.
2. Run the SFT runtime against the actual model and prepared splits.
3. Run the reset-aware RLOO runtime on top of the SFT checkpoint and collect the first real metrics.
4. Evaluate the hard Countdown slice against the default baseline.
5. Extend the one-shot cleaner toward multi-step cleaning and selective memory retention.
