# Learning to Reset

This repository explores dynamic context management for mathematical reasoning with a `<clean>` token, a one-shot reset manager, and reward shaping for reset-aware training.

## Current Scope

The repository currently covers three core software primitives:

- SFT trace curation that teaches the model when to emit `<clean>`
- A one-shot context manager that handles `y0 -> optional <clean> -> y1`
- Modified RLOO utilities that propagate the final reward through both segments
- Dataset loaders and prompt builders for trace and Countdown-style records
- Deterministic split and batching helpers for future training/evaluation loops

This is an initial research scaffold, not a full training pipeline yet. The next major milestone is wiring actual datasets and prepared batches into model training and evaluation loops.

- `docs/code-walkthrough.md`: file-by-file explanation of the code and jargon
- `docs/current-approaches.md`: summary of current methods and the project gap
- `docs/project-plan.md`: architecture, task traceability, and verification plan
- `docs/extension-roadmap.md`: future direction for multi-step cleaning and memory-aware control

## Quick Start

Run the tests:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Run the baseline mechanics demo:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m learning_to_reset
```

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Point the loaders at the actual expert-trace and Countdown source files.
2. Connect the context manager and modified RLOO math to real training loops.
3. Add evaluation code around actual model generations.
4. Extend the one-shot cleaner toward multi-step cleaning and selective memory retention.
